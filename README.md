# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Instructions for Local Installation
These instructions explain how to set up the project on your local machine.

1. Forking the Project for Development

Forking: If you wish to make contributions of changes back to the original project, then you need to fork it. This is essentially a way of creating a copy of the repository in your own account on the hosting platform. After forking, proceed to the next step.

2. Downloading the Project (If forked):

If you forked the project, go to your forked repository on the hosting platform. Click the "Code" button (or similar) and select the download ZIP file.

3. Extracting the Project

Open up your computer to locate the downloaded ZIP file. Right-click the file and click on "Extract All" (or the appropriate term for your operating system). Select a suitable directory to extract the files into. This will create a new folder containing the project's code.

4. Opening the Project in Your IDE:

Open your favorite IDE (for instance, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or PyCharm). Open up the folder, using the option "Open Folder" or "Open Project", to the newly extracted project directory.

5. Navigate to src Directory:

Open the integrated terminal in your IDE. It is crucial that the current working directory of the terminal is set to the src folder (or the directory containing the main application code) inside the project folder. Use the cd command in the terminal to change to the appropriate directory if necessary, for example, cd src.

6. Installing Dependencies:

In the terminal, run the following command:

Bash

npm install
This command installs all the required libraries and dependencies using the Node Package Manager (npm). Depending on the size of the project and your internet connection, this may take some time.

7. Running the Project Locally:

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

Bash

npm run dev
This command, defined in the project's package.json file, starts the local development server. The terminal output will typically display the URL where you can access the running application (e.g., http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your web browser to view the application.
